# Readme

This is a very basic alfred workflow designed to quick add tasks to teuxdeux, its the only feature missing for me (that and future scheduling without having to manually go to that date and add things...may I'll add that in another script)

It uses nodeJS and Puppeteer. Tested using nodejs `v18.8.0`.

You will need Alfred version `5.x` and a powerpack licence.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --global alfred-adeux-teux-teux-deux
```

Don't forget to set `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`, They are stored unencrypted fyi, use this at your own risk.
